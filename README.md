CW Implementation

So we have solve for next tasks.

 1.trajectory file for converting and converting the built-in sensors of the device into a motion path.
 
 2.Symb_Development_2DOF.m and Symb_Development_3DOF.m as follows from the names of the symbolic
   representation of dynamics for 2 and 3 degrees of freedom.
   
 3.DOF.m the implementation of degrees of freedom for 3 or more link manipulators with the initial
  data for modeling. the result is the coefficients of the dynamics equation. for the convenience of further work with them.
