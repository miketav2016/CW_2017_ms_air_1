# CW_2017_ms_air_1
CW Implementation

So we have solve for next tasks.

 1.trajectory file for converting and converting the built-in sensors of the device into a motion path.
 
 2.Symb_Development_2DOF.m and Symb_Development_3DOF.m as follows from the names of the symbolic
   representation of dynamics for 2 and 3 degrees of freedom.
   
 3.DOF.m the implementation of degrees of freedom for 3 or more link manipulators with the initial
  data for modeling. the result is the coefficients of the dynamics equation. for the convenience of further work with them.
  
 4. salampopolam.ev3 Slam Implementation for robot arm.
 
 
 How it work.
  for 1/2/3 points we will use matlab( better used Matlab2015a - exactly works)
  for 4 point we will use LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition.
